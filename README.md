some useful scripts/tips to scrape/download manga pages from various websites
# changelog
20.10.24 - I added my biggest project of all time. I called it "Abandoned Titles Hunter." It parses random manga from Mangalib and adds abandoned titles automatically. It uses the Cloudflare bypass Python library to correctly send POST requests and bypasses login through VK using your cookies and xsrf+csrf tokens. <br>
27.09.24 - added jcomic scraper that bypasses sh1tty cloudflarestorage and direct .XML downloads. Written by GPT and tested by myself. I don't know if it works with every manga from this website, but I'll test it once more one day.
